Wanna Be My Date? 💘

Welcome to the most romantic and fun project you'll see today! 😍 This is a playful page built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ask the classic question: "Will you be my date?" But with a twist—because, of course, it’s never that simple! 😂

What’s This About? 🤔

Imagine you ask someone out, but the "No" button keeps running away, making it impossible to reject you! 😈 Meanwhile, if they finally give up and click "Yes," a song starts playing and you win their heart! 💖

Key Features

💖 "Yes" Button: Click it, and a lovely surprise awaits (hint: a catchy song)!
😈 "No" Button: This naughty button just won’t stay still! It moves around the screen whenever you try to click it. Good luck!
❤️ Floating Hearts: Because why not add some extra romance to the scene?
🎨 Cute Design: Light pink background, lovely font, and a playful layout to make everything feel like a love letter.
